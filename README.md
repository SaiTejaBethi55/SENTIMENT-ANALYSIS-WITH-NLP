##For this task, I performed sentiment analysis on a dataset of customer reviews using Natural Language Processing techniques. The objective was to classify the text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression. I began by collecting a dataset of customer reviews and preprocessing the text, which included converting all text to lowercase, removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters, eliminating stopwords, tokenizing sentences into words, and applying lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms. I then applied TF-IDF vectorization to convert the processed text into numerical features, ensuring that important terms received higher weight while common words were minimized. I trained a Logistic Regression model on the processed data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and evaluated its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. I also used visualizations like word clouds to identify frequently occurring positive and negative terms in the dataset. Sentiment analysis has practical applications in e-commerce for understanding product reviews, in social media for monitoring public opinion, in customer support for prioritizing feedback, and in finance for analyzing market sentiment from news. I ensured that the model could generalize well despite the challenges of unstructured text data and the limitations of TF-IDF, such as ignoring word order and handling sarcasm. The Jupyter Notebook deliverable demonstrates all steps from preprocessing to modeling and evaluation, including clear explanations and visualizations. This project allowed me to build a working NLP pipeline capable of extracting meaningful insights from text data, showcasing both technical skills in machine learning and practical understanding of real-world sentiment analysisÂ applications.
